## Configuring Scheduled Notifications
In the previous lecture, you learned how to schedule (local) notifications via scheduleNotificationAsync().

That method takes one argument - an object where you set the content and the trigger.

Besides the properties shown in the previous lecture, other properties could be added.

You find a complete list (+ explanations) of content properties here: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#notificationcontentinput

And a complete list (+ explanations) of trigger properties here: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#notificationtriggerinput

The trigger type may be confusing - it's basically a combination of multiple supported object types.

You could either set an interval in seconds (as we did in the previous lecture) as described here: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#timeintervalnotificationtrigger

Or you set a specific date (incl. time) at which the notification will be delivered: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#datetriggerinput

Or you set a daily time at which the notification will be sent (Android-only): https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#dailynotificationtrigger

Or a weekly trigger (Android-only): https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#weeklynotificationtrigger

Or a yearly trigger (Android-only): https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#yearlynotificationtrigger

Or a specific date (iOS-only): https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#calendarnotificationtrigger


###Local Notifications - Permissions
When using Expo Go, you shouldn't need to ask for any permissions to send or show local notifications (or notifications in general).

This will change as you build your app for production though. Even when using Expo's managed workflow, you will then leave the Expo Go app (as a standalone app will be built by EAS - see section 14).

To ensure that notifications work correctly, you should therefore ask for permission. For Android, no changes are required. For iOS, you can use the getPermissionsAsync() method (documentation) provided by expo-notifications to get the current permission status. You can use requestPermissionsAsync() (documentation link) to request permissions.

A full code example can be found here but I will also walk you through the entire permission setup later in this section as well.
